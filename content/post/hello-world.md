## Hello World

One of my goals for 2023 is to start a professional site/blog as I continue my journey as Software Developer. The main goal of this blog is to do more learning in public and to share what I learn with the people who find this blog.
I would also like to set up some sort of CD pipeline using github actions.

## WhoAmI

My name is Ryan Monaghan I'm currently a software engineer who primarily focuses on C#. I've been a software developer for about 3 years and before that, I taught High School Computer Science. Teaching and learning have been a big part of my life and it is something I am very passionate about. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing board games, video games (PC), and collecting fountain pens. I'm an avid podcast listener and some of my favorite podcasts are

- [The Pen Addict](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict/) 
- [ATP](https://atp.fm/)
- [Connected](https://www.relay.fm/connected/)
- [Huberman Lab](https://hubermanlab.com/)
- [Security This Week](https://securitythisweek.com/)
- [Top Four](https://www.relay.fm/topfour/)
- [Corecursive](https://corecursive.com/)
- [Coding Blocks](https://www.codingblocks.net/)

## A bit about this site

This site is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), served by [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) and hosted on [Linode](https://www.linode.com/). Another major goal of mine in 2023 is to get better with Go so I'm hoping by focusing on a Go specific stack for this site that it will inspire me to tinker and play it.


Adios and thanks for reading!
