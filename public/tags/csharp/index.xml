      <description>Intro I came across C# scripting a few months ago as my team was trying to decide on a standard for how we wanted to share little scripts we had written to do small tasks. Traditionally I&amp;rsquo;d use a tool like LinqPad to accomplish this, but since we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to buy a Enterprise License we decided to try out C# Scripts. I&amp;rsquo;ve been surprised by how nice it is to have a small scratch pad to test out new ideas or to rapidly prototype a solution.</description>
